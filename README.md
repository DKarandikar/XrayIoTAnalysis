# XrayIoTAnalysis

Repository of tools to aid in gaining and analysing network traffic data from IoT devices

## Folders 

AutomatedCapture contains scripts for automatically capturing traffic from smart assistant devices by playing audio files via speakers. It also contains scripts for recording the responses from these devices.

CapturingUI contains a minimal UI useful for capturing and separating network traffic when working with multiple IoT devices simultaneously

CategoryBasedAnalysis contains several scripts related to data processing and machine learning. These are in aid of attempting to predict the category of question asked from only the encrypted traffic from smart assistant devices. 

TimeBasedAnalysis contains scripts for generating graphs that look at .pcap files over time. These are useful for visualising and understanding the operation of IoT devices.
